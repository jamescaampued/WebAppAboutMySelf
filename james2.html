	<p>
		     Many of us are so close with their family. But in my case, Im so far with my family and relatives and we're not having time for each other for a long time.
			 so I miss them so much. But when I think of them, there's a strenght within me that pushes me to study hardd and persue my dreams.
			 So I always pray to God that someday I will be them just for a week for us to have fun and experience true bonding of a family.
